# LLMMergeGA

LLMMergeGA is a genetic algorithm implementation for merging layers from different language models (LLMs) to create an optimized merged model. The goal is to combine the strengths of individual LLMs and create a model that performs better on benchmark tasks.

## Features

- Merges layers from different LLMs using a genetic algorithm approach
- Supports customizable hyperparameters for population size, number of generations, crossover rate, mutation rate, and elitism rate
- Evaluates the fitness of merged models based on accuracy and loss on benchmark data
- Performs selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism operations to evolve the population
- Utilizes parallel processing to speed up fitness evaluations
- Tracks the best individual (merged model) found during the algorithm's run

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Prepare your LLMs and benchmark data:
   - Ensure that your LLMs are compatible with the expected layer structure and interface
   - Prepare your benchmark data in the form of PyTorch tensors

2. Create an instance of the `LLMMergeGA` class:
   ```python
   llm_merge_ga = LLMMergeGA(
       llms=llms,
       benchmark_data=benchmark_data,
       population_size=100,
       max_generations=50,
       crossover_rate=0.8,
       mutation_rate=0.1,
       elitism_rate=0.1,
       device='cuda'
   )
   ```

3. Run the genetic algorithm:
   ```python
   best_individual = llm_merge_ga.run()
   ```

4. Evaluate the best merged model:
   ```python
   best_model = llm_merge_ga.merge_layers(best_individual)
   accuracy = llm_merge_ga.evaluate_accuracy(best_model)
   loss = llm_merge_ga.evaluate_loss(best_model)
   ```

## Customization

- Modify the `is_compatible` method to define the compatibility criteria for merging layers based on your specific requirements
- Implement the `calculate_accuracy` and `calculate_loss` methods to match your task and evaluation metrics
- Adjust the hyperparameters (`population_size`, `max_generations`, `crossover_rate`, `mutation_rate`, `elitism_rate`) to fine-tune the algorithm's behavior
- Customize the `crossover` and `mutation` methods to incorporate domain-specific knowledge or heuristics for generating offspring
- Implement early stopping, model checkpointing, or adaptive hyperparameter tuning to handle cases where the merged models fail to converge or produce suboptimal results
